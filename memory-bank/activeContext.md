# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**

*   Payment Worker (Kafka Consumer) has been successfully implemented.
*   Asynchronous payment processing is now operational.
*   Ready to implement Cache invalidation mechanism and Inquiry Service.
*   Planning integration of Redis caching and PostgreSQL replica reading.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Successfully started all Docker services (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis, Zookeeper).
*   Built and deployed Payment Service Spring Boot application.
*   Fixed database connection configuration mismatch.
*   Implemented Payment Worker with Kafka consumer functionality.
*   Enhanced Payment Service to send messages to Kafka asynchronously.
*   Added proper error handling and logging throughout the system.
*   Verified Payment Service API endpoints are operational (HTTP 200 responses).
*   Updated project progress documentation.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Implement Cache invalidation mechanism for Redis.
2.  Implement Inquiry Service API for balance and transaction queries.
3.  Integrate Redis caching for read operations.
4.  Configure reading from PostgreSQL replicas.
5.  Set up API Gateway and Load Balancer.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   Implementing Cache-Aside pattern for Redis integration.
*   Configuring Spring Boot to use multiple data sources (primary for writes, replicas for reads).
*   Designing Payment Worker to handle transaction processing asynchronously.
*   Ensuring data consistency between cache and database.

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**

*   Using Docker Compose for environment setup and management.
*   Following a microservices architecture.
*   Prioritizing reliability and low latency.
*   Implementing asynchronous processing with Kafka.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

*   PostgreSQL replication requires careful configuration of both the primary and replica servers.
*   Docker Compose can simplify the deployment and management of complex systems.
*   Spring Boot with Kafka integration provides robust asynchronous processing capabilities.
*   Proper caching strategies are crucial for high-read scenarios.
