# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**

*   [x] **Decoupled Payment Worker from Payment Service** - COMPLETE
*   [ ] Ready to implement Cache invalidation mechanism and Inquiry Service.
*   [ ] Planning integration of Redis caching and PostgreSQL replica reading.

**Recent Changes:**

*   [x] Successfully started all Docker services (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis, Zookeeper).
*   [x] Built and deployed Payment Service Spring Boot application.
*   [x] Fixed database connection configuration mismatch.
*   [x] Implemented Payment Worker with Kafka consumer functionality.
*   [x] Enhanced Payment Service to send messages to Kafka asynchronously.
*   [x] Added proper error handling and logging throughout the system.
*   [x] Verified Payment Service API endpoints are operational (HTTP 200 responses).
*   [x] Updated project progress documentation.
*   [x] **Bước 1 hoàn thành**: Khởi tạo dự án `payment-worker` với cấu trúc Spring Boot cơ bản.
*   [x] **Bước 2 hoàn thành**: Di chuyển và tách biệt mã nguồn (PaymentWorker, PaymentRequest, Payment, PaymentRepository).
*   [x] **Bước 3 hoàn thành**: Cấu hình cho `payment-worker` (application.yml với port 8081, Kafka consumer, database).
*   [x] **Bước 4 hoàn thành**: Tái cấu trúc `payment-service` (xóa thư mục worker, cập nhật PaymentService để chỉ gửi Kafka message).
*   [x] **Bước 5 hoàn thành**: Cập nhật Cấu hình Triển khai (Docker Compose) - thêm service payment-worker.
*   [x] **Bước 6 hoàn thành**: Kiểm thử và Xác minh - cả payment-service và payment-worker đều compile thành công.
*   [x] **Fixed Docker build error**: Created Dockerfiles for both services and updated docker-compose.yml.
*   [x] **Fixed "Broker may not be available" error**: Updated application.yml files to use Spring Profiles for Docker environment.

**Next Steps:**

1.  [ ] Implement Cache invalidation mechanism for Redis.
2.  [ ] Implement Inquiry Service API for balance and transaction queries.
3.  [ ] Integrate Redis caching for read operations.
4.  [ ] Configure reading from PostgreSQL replicas.
5.  [ ] Set up API Gateway and Load Balancer.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   Implementing Cache-Aside pattern for Redis integration.
*   Configuring Spring Boot to use multiple data sources (primary for writes, replicas for reads).
*   Designing Payment Worker to handle transaction processing asynchronously.
*   Ensuring data consistency between cache and database.

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**

*   Using Docker Compose for environment setup and management.
*   Following a microservices architecture.
*   Prioritizing reliability and low latency.
*   Implementing asynchronous processing with Kafka.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

*   PostgreSQL replication requires careful configuration of both the primary and replica servers.
*   Docker Compose can simplify the deployment and management of complex systems.
*   Spring Boot with Kafka integration provides robust asynchronous processing capabilities.
*   Proper caching strategies are crucial for high-read scenarios.
